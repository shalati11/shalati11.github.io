        </div>
        <p> For me I like to play fotball in my free time and I think it is very fun and full of joy top play with
            friends.
        </p>
        <p>My <strong>Best friends </strong> are all from the <strong>Helsingborg Mosque</strong> </p>
        <h2 class="thirdtitle1"> Why do I like Helsingborg,Mosque?</h2>
        <p class="longtext1">I like the Mosque because of course I am a muslim and I have to go to the mosque but also
            becuase
            I like how they treat us there. Everyone is very kind and everyone wants to help you get better.
            Me I also have a group of friends and a teacher that teaches us the Quran and about the profet Muhammed
            <strong>
                Sala allahu aleyhi wa salam</strong>
            they also take us out sometimes to play fotball or just to have fun together and everyone likes eachother
            and
            respect is the main thing we all have together.
