      <strong>
        I learned this with help of my dads friend who works with AI and he helped me learn all of this
        and how to program things on a computer.
        When I was in 8th grade i did like an test to his job one week and i learned a little but now
        its summer so there is no school so i come to him every day to let him teach me about AI and
        this is my first project i do by myself.
